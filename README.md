This project tries to document, demonstrate and collect Plugin-GUIs for the Xemu project.

### Directory: plugingui-gtk

Though Xemu has a built-in GTK GUI, this is very quick hack to try the GTK GUI as form of a plugin. The purpose is more to test if this plugin-GUI API works at with some code known to be working built-in already.
